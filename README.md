# VideoClassification
Video Action Recognition using Youtube Action Classification Dataset ( http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~liujg/YouTube_Action_dataset.htmlâ€‹ )
This is a self-project. In this I used rolling averaging over predictions over frames in videos.<br />
Model weights obtained after training are available at : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XznbsYp03S9tgLA6ajjJlrvGcGsW-t8a<br />
Testing accuracy of 94 per cent was obtained and some of the youtube videos on which the results were seen are put in this github repository.
